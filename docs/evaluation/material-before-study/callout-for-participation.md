# Callout for Participation

Hey, we are three motivated students planning to perform a study to evaluate our tool to manage Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) [1] on GitHub.
We are looking for software professionals to test our tool and give feedback on the practical usage.

## Purpose of this Study

The ADR Manager is a web-based tool to create and edit Markdown-based ADRs (MADRs) [2] on GitHub.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional suitability and usability of the ADR Manager to support the creation and editing of ADRs. By involving software professionals who have experience with ADRs, we hope to gain insights to further improve the tool.

The goal of this study is _**NOT**_ to evaluate the abilities of participants.

## Confidentiality and Anonymity

Everything that is said in the study is treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside our research team without the participantâ€™s permission. Results are aggregated and anonymized before publication. In no way can individual statements be traced back to a participant. After the study, participants also have the possibility to exclude or redact statements before the analysis. The complete study transcripts will _**NOT**_ be published.

## Study Process and Analysis

Participants will be notified about the study and will be sent the material.
The study is split into two parts:
First, the participant will use the tool to solve a small written task while thinking aloud.
Second, there will be a short interview about the experience.
Study time is estimated between 20 to 40 minutes.
We kindly ask your permission to record the screen and audio during the entire study for transcription.
The written transcript will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval.
This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the study.
After that, the recording will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved transcript will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.


We would be very happy about your participation! 
If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
