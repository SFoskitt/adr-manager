This document describes the general guidelines and ethical considerations of this interview study.

## Purpose of this Study

The ADR Manager is a web based tool to edit MADRs on GitHub.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability and functional suitability of the ADR Manager to support the creation and editing of ADRs. By involving software professionals who have experience with ADRs we hope to gain insights in the practical usage of the tool.

The goal of this study is _**NOT**_ to evaluate the abilities of participants.

## Confidentiality and Anonymity

Everything that is said in the study is treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside our research team without the participantâ€™s permission. Results are aggregated and anonymized before publication. In no way can individual statements be traced back to a participant. After the study, participants also have the possibility to exclude or redact statements before the analysis. The complete study transcripts will _**NOT**_ be published.

## Study Process and Analysis

Participants will be notified about the study and will be sent the material.
The study is split into two parts: Firstly, the participant will use the tool while thinking aloud. Secondly, there will be an interview. Study time is estimated between 20 to 40 minutes. We kindly ask your permission to record the screen and audio during the entire study for transcription. The written transcript will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval. This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the study. After that, the recording will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved transcript will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.
