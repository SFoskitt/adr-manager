# Interview Guide

The following sections contain the basic agenda for our semi-structured interviews.
We will loosely follow these questions based on the participant's responses.

<!-- before the think aloud study -->
## Demographic and Professional Background

* Role (e. g. (Lead) Developer, (Lead) Architect, Data Engineer)
* General Domain (e. g. Web, Front end, Back end, data science, something completely different)
* Years of professional experience
* Experience with ADRs (used for how long?, what team size?)
  * How standardized are the used ADRs? If there is a standard which template?
  * Experience with MADRs?
* Which tools do you use to manage ADRs? (e. g. adr-tools + GitHub editor or local text editor like VSC, IntelliJ, etc.)


<!-- after the think aloud study -->
## Functional Suitability

* Which functionality did you find lacking?
* Which functionality would you need to consider using the tool in your professional work?

## Usability

* Do you like the interface?
* Is the interface intuitive for you?
* Which modes would you use most often? Would you switch between modes? 
<!--or some question asking whether we need three vs. two vs. one mode-->

Some semi-quantitative questions: <!-- maybe some generic questionnaire that I don't know yet -->
* In general: Would you prefer to have a GUI-based tool specifically for ADRs? (1-5)
* Would you prefer the ADR Manager over existing tools? (1-5)
* How likely are you to use the ADR Manager in the future? (1-5)
